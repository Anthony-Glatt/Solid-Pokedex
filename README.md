# Solid-Pokedex
A Pokedex PWA built with SolidJS and TypeScript

SolidJS: Reactive JS library

TypeScript: Open source JS language for adding static typing and optional type annotations

## Testing
vitest - testing framework that includes runner, assertion engine, and mocking facilities

jsdom - a virtual DOM used to simulate a headless browser environment running in node

@solidjs/testing-library - a library to simplify testing components, directives, and primitives, with automatic cleanup

@testing-library/user-event - used to simulate user events that are closer to reality

@testing-library/jest-dom - augments expect with helpful matchers

## Development Server
Vite

## Dependencies
solid-js - Solid is a declarative JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. Instead of using a Virtual DOM, it compiles its templates to real DOM nodes and updates them with fine-grained reactions.

babel-preset-solid - to transform JSX into Solid runtime calls.

@solidjs/router - Solid Router is a universal router for SolidJS. A router lets you change your view based on the URL in the browser. This allows your "single-page" application to simulate a traditional multipage site.

@solidjs/testing-library - a very lightweight solution for testing Solid components.

@testing-library/jest-dom - a library provides a set of custom jest matchers that you can use to extend jest.

@testing-library/user-event - Tries to simulate the real events that would happen in the browser as the user interacts with it.

jsdom - The project is to emulate enough of a subset of a web browser to be useful for testing and scraping real-world web applications.

typescript - A language for application-scale JavaScript. TypeScript adds optional types to JavaScript that support tools for large-scale JavaScript applications

vite - A  frontend build tool that significantly improves the frontend development experience. It consists of two major parts:

  A dev server that serves your source files over native ES modules, with rich built-in features and astonishingly fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

  A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.

vite-plugin-solid - A simple integration to run solid-js with vite

vitest - Next generation testing framework powered by Vite.
