# Solid-Pokedex
After some new insights, I believe solidstart could better serve this applications purpose. After some more research, I'll make the changes tomorrow.

A Pokedex PWA built with SolidJS and TypeScript

SolidJS: Reactive JS library

TypeScript: Open source JS language for adding static typing and optional type annotations

## Testing
vitest - testing framework that includes runner, assertion engine, and mocking facilities

jsdom - a virtual DOM used to simulate a headless browser environment running in node

@solidjs/testing-library - a library to simplify testing components, directives, and primitives, with automatic cleanup

@testing-library/user-event - used to simulate user events that are closer to reality

@testing-library/jest-dom - augments expect with helpful matchers

## Development Server
Vite
